            "Okay, the user asked about the history of San Francisco. Let me start by recalling what I know. San Francisco is a city in California, USA. It was founded in the 18th century, right? I think the Spanish established a mission there. Maybe Mission San Francisco de Asís? That was in 1776. Then it became part of Mexico after Mexico's independence from Spain. The Mexican-American War led to the US taking over, so maybe the city became part of the US in the mid-19th century.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Gold Rush in 1849 brought a lot of people, which made the city grow quickly. The population exploded. Then there was the 1906 earthquake and fire, which destroyed much of the city. After that, they rebuilt. The city hosted the Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915 to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal. That's a big event.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 20th century, San Francisco became known for the counterculture movement in the 1960s, like the Summer of Love. The LGBTQ+ community also found a home there, especially with the Stonewall riots in 1969, though that was in New York. Wait, maybe the city's role in LGBTQ+ rights started earlier? The 1970s had Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California. He was assassinated in 1978. The city has been a hub for tech with Silicon Valley nearby, leading to the dot-com boom in the 90s and the current tech industry. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is another significant event. \n",
            "\n",
            "I should check if there are any other key points. The city's architecture, like the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Also, the Chinatown is one of the oldest in the US. The Beat Generation in the 1950s, with figures like Jack Kerouac. The city's role in the civil rights movement, maybe the Black Panther Party. The Tenderloin district as a cultural area. The tech boom's impact on housing and gentrification. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, the user might want a concise history without too many details. Let me structure it chronologically. Start with founding, then Gold Rush, earthquake, 20th-century cultural movements, tech industry, and recent issues. Make sure to mention key events and their significance. Avoid any inaccuracies. Also, check if there's any information from the provided context that's relevant. The context mentions setting a user-agent and respecting robot policy, but that's about web scraping. Since the user is asking for history, the context doesn't directly affect the answer. So proceed with the history points.\n",

            "San Francisco, a city in northern California, has a rich and diverse history marked by several pivotal events:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Founding and Early Years**:  \n",
            "   - Established in 1776 by Spanish missionaries as **Mission San Francisco de Asís**, it became part of Mexico after Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821.  \n",
            "   - The U.S. acquired the region following the **Mexican-American War (1846–1848)**, and San Francisco was incorporated as a city in 1849.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Gold Rush Era (1848–1855)**:  \n",
            "   - The **California Gold Rush** (1848) transformed San Francisco into a bustling hub. Its population surged from a few hundred to over 25,000 in just a few years, driven by prospectors and entrepreneurs.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **1906 Earthquake and Fire**:  \n",
            "   - A devastating **earthquake and fire** in 1906 destroyed much of the city. The disaster led to a massive rebuilding effort, including the construction of the **Golden Gate Bridge** (completed in 1937).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Cultural and Social Movements**:  \n",
            "   - The **1960s counterculture movement** (e.g., the **Summer of Love**) and the **LGBTQ+ rights movement** (e.g., **Harvey Milk**, the first openly gay elected official in California, assassinated in 1978) made San Francisco a global symbol of activism and diversity.  \n",
            "   - The city also played a key role in the **civil rights movement** and the **Beat Generation** literary scene in the 1950s.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Tech Industry and Modern Challenges**:  \n",
            "   - Proximity to **Silicon Valley** fueled the **dot-com boom** in the 1990s and the current tech industry, reshaping the city’s economy and culture.  \n",
            "   - The **1989 Loma Prieta earthquake** caused significant damage, highlighting ongoing seismic risks.  \n",
            "   - Recent decades have seen debates over **gentrification, housing affordability, and homelessness** due to tech-driven growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Iconic Landmarks**:  \n",
            "   - **Alcatraz**, **Fisherman’s Wharf**, **Chinatown** (one of the oldest in the U.S.), and the **Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)** are enduring symbols of the city’s history and innovation.\n",
