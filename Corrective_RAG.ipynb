            "Okay, the user is asking about the climate of San Francisco. Let me start by recalling what I know. San Francisco is on the West Coast of the United States, in California. I remember it's known for being foggy and having a cool climate compared to other parts of California, like Los Angeles.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I should mention the general climate type. I think it's a Mediterranean climate, which means mild, wet winters and dry summers. But wait, Mediterranean climates usually have hot summers, but San Francisco is more moderate. Maybe it's influenced by the ocean. The Pacific Ocean is nearby, so the marine influence probably keeps temperatures cooler. That's why it's not as hot as inland areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fog is a big part of San Francisco's climate. The fog comes in from the ocean, especially in the summer. The cold California Current along the coast might contribute to that. Also, the city's topography—being surrounded by water on three sides (Bay, Pacific, and the hills)—affects the fog patterns. The fog tends to roll in during the afternoon, making it cooler in the city than in nearby areas like Oakland.\n",
            "\n",
            "Temperatures: I should note that San Francisco has a narrow temperature range. Winters are mild, maybe around 45-55°F (7-13°C), and summers are cool, maybe 55-65°F (13-18°C). The highest temperatures are rare, maybe in the 70s°F (20s°C) during heatwaves. The lowest temperatures in winter might dip to the 30s°F (-1 to 4°C) but not often.\n",
            "\n",
            "Precipitation: Most rain comes in the winter, from November to March. Summers are dry. Annual rainfall is around 20 inches (50 cm), which is less than some other cities. Snow is extremely rare, maybe once every few decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "Winds: The city experiences strong winds, especially in the summer. The wind patterns are influenced by the topography and the pressure systems. The famous \"breezy\" conditions, especially in places like Ocean Beach or the Presidio.\n",
            "\n",
            "Microclimates: San Francisco has a lot of microclimates because of its hills and the bay. For example, the Sunset District is foggiest, while downtown might be a bit warmer. The East Bay is warmer than the West Side. This variation means that temperatures can differ significantly within the city.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, the user mentioned that the retrieved context is insufficient or irrelevant. So I need to point out what's missing. Maybe specific data like exact rainfall amounts, average temperatures for each month, or details on how the fog affects daily life. Also, maybe the impact of the marine layer, the role of the Golden Gate in wind patterns, or how climate change is affecting the area. Without specific data, my answer is general. I should mention that more detailed information would require specific data points or recent studies.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also check if there are any common misconceptions. For example, people might think San Francisco is always cold, but it's actually quite comfortable year-round. Or that it's always foggy, but fog is more prevalent in summer. Also, the contrast with other California cities like LA, which is much hotter and drier.\n",
            "\n",
            "Putting it all together, the answer should cover the climate type, temperature ranges, precipitation patterns, fog and wind, microclimates, and note the missing specific data points. Make sure to highlight the marine influence and the city's unique geography contributing to its climate.\n",

            "San Francisco, located on California’s West Coast, experiences a **temperate marine climate** influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Key characteristics include:  \n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Temperature**:  \n",
            "   - Mild, wet winters (November–March) with average highs of 50–55°F (10–13°C) and lows of 40–45°F (4–7°C).  \n",
            "   - Cool, dry summers (June–September) with highs of 60–65°F (15–18°C) and lows of 50–55°F (10–13°C).  \n",
            "   - Extreme temperatures are rare; summer heatwaves may push highs into the 70s°F (21–26°C), while winter lows rarely drop below 30°F (-1°C).  \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Fog and Wind**:  \n",
            "   - Frequent fog, especially in summer, driven by the cold California Current and the city’s topography. Fog often rolls in from the Pacific, cooling coastal areas.  \n",
            "   - Strong winds, particularly in summer, due to pressure systems and the Golden Gate’s funneling effect.  \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Precipitation**:  \n",
            "   - Annual rainfall averages ~20 inches (50 cm), concentrated in winter. Summers are nearly rain-free.  \n",
            "   - Snow is exceptionally rare, with only a few recorded instances in the 20th century.  \n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Microclimates**:  \n",
            "   - The city’s hills and water bodies create stark local variations. For example, foggy western neighborhoods (e.g., the Sunset District) contrast with warmer, sunnier areas like downtown.  \n",
            "\n",
            "**Missing Context**:  \n",
            "The answer lacks specific data points such as exact monthly averages, recent climate trends (e.g., impacts of climate change), or detailed studies on fog frequency. Additionally, while the marine influence is highlighted, deeper analysis of oceanic currents or topographic effects (e.g., the Golden Gate’s role in wind patterns) would enhance the explanation. For precise statistics (e.g., 2023 rainfall totals), local meteorological sources would be necessary.  \n",
            "\n",
            "**Note**: San Francisco’s climate is distinct from inland California, offering a comfortable, year-round environment but with notable fog and wind compared to warmer coastal cities like Los Angeles.\n"
