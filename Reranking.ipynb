Then it says it's characteristic of California's coast with moist winters and dry summers. So I should note that it's a Mediterranean climate with those specific seasons.\n",

            "Next, the context explains that the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay influence the weather, moderating temperature swings and leading to a mild year-round climate with little seasonal variation. That's important for describing the overall mildness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there are some temperature statistics: the warmest night is 64°F and the coldest day is 49°F during 1991-2020. Also, the coldest daytime high since 1945 was 37°F in 1972. These numbers give specific temperature ranges, which can be included to show the typical temperatures.\n",
            "\n",
            "The context also mentions that as a coastal city, San Francisco is affected by climate change, with projected sea level rise and related issues. However, the question is about the current climate, not future projections, so maybe that part isn't necessary unless it's relevant. But the user said to use only the context, so if the question is about the current climate, the climate change part might not be needed here. Let me check the question again: \"What is the climate of San Francisco?\" So focus on the current classification and characteristics.\n",

The key is to use only the context provided and answer based on that without adding external knowledge.\n",
